## What it does

This app takes your resume, reads it with AI magic, and then:
1. Suggests ways to make it better 💡
2. Gives your resume a score out of 10 🏆
3. Explains why it gave that score 🤔

## Tech Stack

1. Flask
2. Google Gemini
3. HTML/CSS


## How to use it

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the stuff you need:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Run the app:

```python app.py```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
5. Upload your resume and see the magic happen!

## What you need

- Python 3.7 or newer
- Flask
- google-generativeai
- Some other stuff (check `requirements.txt`)

## How it works

1. You upload your resume
2. Our AI friend (thanks, Google Gemini!) reads it
3. The AI thinks really hard about your resume
4. It tells you how to improve and gives you a score

## Known issues

- Sometimes the AI gets confused by weird formats 🙃
- It might give strange advice for very specific jobs

## Future plans

I want to make it even cooler by:
- Adding support for more file types
- Making the suggestions more specific
- Adding a feature to edit your resume right in the app
